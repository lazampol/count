		<h2>About:</h2>
		<div>
			<p> The Count von Count is a mysterious vampire who lives in an old castle near the Sesame street.</p>
			<img src="img/castle.jpg"> <p class="legenda">Watching his favorite shows: 24 and 60 minutes</p>
			<p>In an interview, the Count revealed his castle has:</p><ul class="lista">
			<li>41 rooms</li><li> 27 chandeliers</li><li> 91 doors</li><li> 31 closets</li><li> 126 windows (most of which are broken)</li><li> 14 stairways with a total of 301 stairs</li><li> 32 sofas</li><li> 27 easy chairs</li><li> 72,000 bathroom tiles</li><li> 22 soap dishes</li><li> 7 hair brushes</li><li>one fangbrush</li></ul>

		
			<p>How does he know that? Infortunately, he has arithmomania: a mental disorder which makes him count anything and everything. He sometimes even counts himself!</p> <p> When he finishes counting, the Count laughs and announces his total, usually accompanied by a crash of thunder and a flash of lightning, even on sunny days, because he has a personal cloud that hovers over his head and provides the thunder and lightning!</p><br>

			<p>Despite being a vampire, he's very sociable and has several friends at Sesame street. However, I don't know if his friends are safe, because I don't know what he eats!</p>
